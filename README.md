Hi there! 👋


I'm Lafir, a Mechanical Engineer tuning my HP's to become a better Data Analyst and Data Scientist.


Always a Learner! 🤓


Now I'm learning Python, Tableau, Advanced Excel and SQL. 
On my Github profile, I share my projects on software,
web development, data science and machine learning. 


Programming is fun. 


You can reach me @LinkedIn or @Twitter 
for any tech talks or feel free to give 
me any advise / tip on how to become a pro in Data Science / ML.😁
